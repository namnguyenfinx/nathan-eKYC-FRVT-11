FRVT 1:1 eKYC Test Cases
This repository contains a list of test cases for the FRVT 1:1 eKYC benchmark. The purpose of these test cases is to provide a standardized set of scenarios to evaluate the performance of eKYC systems in real-world situations.

Test Cases
The test cases cover a range of scenarios, including:

Basic enrollment: A new user enrolls in the system using a government-issued ID.
Identity verification: An existing user verifies their identity using their enrolled biometric data and government-issued ID.
Remote onboarding: A new user enrolls in the system remotely, without being physically present at a bank branch.
Biometric authentication: An existing user logs into the system using their enrolled biometric data.
Cross-device authentication: An existing user logs into the system using a different device than they enrolled with.
Cross-channel authentication: An existing user logs into the system using a different channel than they enrolled with (e.g. mobile app vs web browser).
Enrollment with expired ID: A new user attempts to enroll in the system using an expired government-issued ID.
Enrollment with fake ID: A new user attempts to enroll in the system using a fake government-issued ID.
Identity verification with incorrect ID: An existing user attempts to verify their identity using an incorrect government-issued ID.
Identity verification with incorrect biometric data: An existing user attempts to verify their identity using incorrect biometric data.
Identity verification with fake ID: An existing user attempts to verify their identity using a fake government-issued ID.
Remote onboarding with expired ID: A new user attempts to enroll in the system remotely using an expired government-issued ID.
Remote onboarding with fake ID: A new user attempts to enroll in the system remotely using a fake government-issued ID.
Biometric authentication with incorrect data: An existing user attempts to authenticate using incorrect biometric data.
Biometric authentication with different body position: An existing user attempts to authenticate using different body position than enrolled.
Biometric authentication with glasses: An existing user attempts to authenticate while wearing glasses.
Biometric authentication with different lighting: An existing user attempts to authenticate under different lighting conditions than enrolled.
Cross-device authentication with different camera: An existing user attempts to authenticate using a different camera than they enrolled with.
Cross-device authentication with different resolution: An existing user attempts to authenticate using a different camera resolution than they enrolled with.
Cross-channel authentication with different network: An existing user attempts to authenticate using a different network than they enrolled with.
Cross-channel authentication with different browser: An existing user attempts to authenticate using a different browser than they enrolled with.
Biometric authentication with altered biometric data: An existing user attempts to authenticate using altered biometric data.
Identity verification with altered ID: An existing user attempts to verify their identity using an altered government-issued ID.
Biometric authentication with deepfakes: An existing user attempts to authenticate using a deepfake biometric data.
Enrollment with incomplete data: A new user attempts to enroll in the system with incomplete data.
Identity verification with incomplete data: An existing user attempts to verify their identity with incomplete data.
Enrollment with low-quality data: A new user attempts to enroll in the system with low-quality biometric data.
Identity verification with low-quality data: An existing user attempts to verify their identity with low-quality biometric data.
