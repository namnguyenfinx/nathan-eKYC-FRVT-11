FRVT 1:1 eKYC Test Cases
This repository contains a set of test cases for evaluating the performance of face recognition systems in the context of eKYC (electronic know your customer) applications. These test cases cover various scenarios and challenges commonly encountered in real-world eKYC applications.

Purpose
The purpose of these test cases is to evaluate the performance of face recognition systems in the context of eKYC applications. The test cases cover various scenarios and challenges commonly encountered in real-world eKYC applications, and are designed to evaluate the accuracy, speed, and robustness of face recognition systems.

Usage
To use these test cases, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies (OpenCV, NumPy, etc.).
Run the test cases using a face recognition system of your choice.
Test Cases
The test cases are divided into several categories, each covering a different aspect of face recognition performance in the context of eKYC applications. The categories are as follows:

1. Illumination Variation
These test cases evaluate the performance of face recognition systems in varying illumination conditions. The test cases include images taken under different lighting conditions (bright, dim, and mixed lighting), and evaluate the accuracy and robustness of face recognition systems in these conditions.

2. Pose Variation
These test cases evaluate the performance of face recognition systems in varying pose conditions. The test cases include images taken from different angles and perspectives (frontal, 45 degrees, and profile), and evaluate the accuracy and robustness of face recognition systems in these conditions.

3. Expression Variation
These test cases evaluate the performance of face recognition systems in varying expression conditions. The test cases include images taken with different facial expressions (neutral, smiling, and frowning), and evaluate the accuracy and robustness of face recognition systems in these conditions.

4. Occlusion Variation
These test cases evaluate the performance of face recognition systems in varying occlusion conditions. The test cases include images taken with different types of occlusion (glasses, hats, and masks), and evaluate the accuracy and robustness of face recognition systems in these conditions.

5. Age Variation
These test cases evaluate the performance of face recognition systems in varying age conditions. The test cases include images of people of different ages (children, adults, and seniors), and evaluate the accuracy and robustness of face recognition systems in these conditions.

6. Ethnicity Variation
These test cases evaluate the performance of face recognition systems in varying ethnicity conditions. The test cases include images of people from different ethnic backgrounds, and evaluate the accuracy and robustness of face recognition systems in these conditions.

Results
The results of these test cases can be used to evaluate the performance of different face recognition systems in the context of eKYC applications. The results can be used to identify the strengths and weaknesses of different systems, and to guide the development of new systems that are more accurate, robust, and efficient.
